	"content": " Piklist Workflows allow you to add a tabbed system on almost any admin page. Additionally, you can add almost anything you want to each tab.\n  New to Piklist?    Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     IMPORTANT: Each Workflow tab loads a separate page, with a new url. If you change tabs without saving you will lose your data.\nALSO IMPORTANT: Workflows control the ENTIRE page, not just what is located under the tabs.\nEach Workflow needs a minimum of two files:\nHeader file This file goes in the /workflows folder\nThe header sets the main parameters for the entire flow. Entering the parameters into a comment block is all that\u0026rsquo;s required of the header file.\nParameters Flow Define a unique name for your flow. The name will tie together all your tabs. Example: My Flow\nPage What pages the flow should display on. This can be multiple pages, separated by commas. Example: post.php, post-new.php, post-edit.php, admin.php, your_custom_setting\nPost Type For custom post type flows, please define the post type. Example: my_cpt\nHeader Tells Piklist this is a WorkFlow header file. Set this to: true.\nPosition Where on the page should the WorkFlow display. The Workflow system can currently display in five WordPress hook locations:\n'header' =\u0026gt; 'in_admin_header'\n'body' =\u0026gt; 'all_admin_notices'\n'title' =\u0026gt; 'edit_form_after_title'\n'editor' =\u0026gt; 'edit_form_after_editor'\n'profile' =\u0026gt; 'profile_personal_options'\n/* Flow: My Flow Page: post.php, post-new.php, post-edit.php, admin.php Post Type: my_cpt Header: true Position: title */  Tab file This file goes in the /workflows folder\nEach tab in your Workflow gets its own file. Each file uses a comment block to link it to a Workflow.\nTIP: You must create at least two tabs for WorkFlows to show up.\nParameters Title The title of the Workflow tab. Example: My Tab\nOrder Defines the sort order of the tabs. Example: 10\nFlow Should be the same value as the header file. Example: My Flow\nPage What pages the individual tab should display on. This can be multiple pages, separated by commas. Example: post.php, post-new.php, post-edit.php, admin.php\nDefault Sets this tab as the default tab. IMPORTANT: Only use this parameter in ONE of your WorkFlow tab files. Default: true\n/* Title: My Tab Order: 10 Flow: My Flow */  So far we\u0026rsquo;ve created a Workflow and a tab, but we have not shown any content. When you click on a tab you are defining the entire page environment, not just the environment in the tab. You have to define which meta-boxes (or user sections, settings sections, term sections, etc) are shown on the entire page, even in the sidebar. This means when a user clicks on a WorkFlow tab you can hide or show fields in the actual tab and in the sidebar.\nAssign Meta Boxes, Sections, Etc. to Workflows. ** This file goes in the /meta-boxes folder, if you want to assign meta-boxes to this workflow. If you want to assign settings sections, then this file would go in the /settings folder.\nIn this example, we are creating and assigning a meta-box.\nCreate a meta-box the way you normally would with Piklist.\nIn the comment block of your meta box file add the following two parameters:\nTab: My Tab Flow: My Flow  So, if this was the original comment block for your meta box:\n/* Title: Text Fields Post Type: piklist_demo */  It would now look like this:\n/* Title: Text Fields Post Type: piklist_demo Tab: My Tab Flow: My Flow */  Your meta-box will now show up under the “My Tab” tab of your workflow.\n"

This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.      First, we need to register our page with Piklist using the piklist_admin_pages filter. This filter adds additional features to the standard WordPress functions add_menu_page and add_submenu_page.  Add this code to your theme\u0026rsquo;s functions.php file, or in your custom plugin.\nadd_filter('piklist_admin_pages', 'my_admin_pages'); function my_admin_pages($pages) { $pages[] = array( 'page_title' =\u0026gt; 'About this plugin' ,'menu_title' =\u0026gt; 'About' ,'menu_slug' =\u0026gt; 'about_my_plugin' ,'capability' =\u0026gt; 'manage_options' ); return $pages; }  If you go to the WordPress admin you should see a menu item called \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo;.\n Now, create a PHP file in your /parts/admin-pages/ folder. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what you name the file. For this example we\u0026rsquo;ll call it about.php. At the top of the file, add this code:  \u0026lt;?php /* * Page: about_my_plugin */ ?\u0026gt;  This code tells Piklist to place the contents of this file on the about_my_plugin page. Notice that the value that goes in Page: matches the menu_slug you defined when you registered the page.\n NOTE: There are many other options you can add to the Comment Block.\n Under this comment block you can add text, html, php, etc. Anything you want to show on this page.\n  For this tutorial, add the following:\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Now is: \u0026lt;?php echo date('l jS \\of F Y h:i:s A'); ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;  That\u0026rsquo;s it!

	"content": " Building widgets with Piklist is incredibly simple. You can use a fraction of the code WordPress requires to make very powerful widgets. In this tutorial, we will create a widget that includes three fields: select, text and ColorPicker.\n  New to Piklist?    Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.      The first step is to create the proper folder structure in your theme. Create a piklist folder, and then a parts subfolder, and then add a widgets subfolder. Next we need to create the widget files. Piklist widgets are made up of two:  widget-name.php: This file holds the widget output, and is the only required file for a widget. (i.e. example.php) widget-name-form.php: Settings fields for your widget are placed in this file. (i.e. example-form.php)   Widget Settings File Let’s start with example-form.php, which will hold the fields the user will fill in to control the widget. This file is only required if you want to add settings to your widget.\nNow, let’s create our first field, a text box:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Title' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  This simple array will create a text box that automatically saves as a widget setting. The 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' variable tells Piklist what sort of field to render. Also, notice that this is very similar to the way you create fields for meta-boxes.\nNow, let’s create our select field, a select field:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the dropdown.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) ));  Notice that this array is very similar to the one used to create the text box. Just two differences:\n 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select': Tells Piklist that you want to render a select field. The choices array adds your choices.  That’s it! Everything else is the same.\nOne more field to go in this tutorial. Let’s create our colorPicker field. Normally, you would need to add Javascript and CSS to create this field… but not with Piklist!\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Seriously, that’s all you need to create a ColorPicker field. You will notice this is pretty much the same code used to create the text box, except we set 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker'.\nFull Code Snippet for Widget Settings: example-form.php: \u0026lt;?php piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the dropdown.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Widget Output File The output file is the only required file, since settings may not be necessary for some widgets. Open example.php. At the top of the file, we will add a comment block that will control the configuration of the widget. This comment block is very similar to what you would see in a standard WordPress plugin or theme. Here are the minimum variables required:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Title: My Demo Widget Description: A description of what my widget does */  This comment block tells Piklist you want to name your widget, \u0026ldquo;My Demo Widget\u0026rdquo;, with the description showing up in the widget edit screen.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add the standard WordPress widget variables. These are dictated by your theme:\n\u0026lt;?php echo $before_widget; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $before_title; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $after_title; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $after_widget; ?\u0026gt;  Then add in your fields where you want them to show:\n\u0026lt;?php echo $before_widget; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $before_title; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $settings['demo_text']; ?\u0026gt;! \u0026lt;?php echo $after_title; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php echo $settings['demo_select']; ?\u0026gt;! \u0026lt;?php echo $settings['demo_colorpicker']; ?\u0026gt;! \u0026lt;?php echo $after_widget; ?\u0026gt;  You just built a widget!\n"

It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     Each file we add to the the meta-boxes folder will create a metabox on the post edit screen. Each field we include in this file will be part of this metabox. Fairly straightforward. Ok, let’s create our metabox file!\nCreate a new file: let’s call it demo-metabox.php. At the top of the file, we will add a comment block that will control the configuration of the metabox. This comment block is very similar to what you would see in a standard WordPress plugin or theme. Here are the minimum variables required:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Title: My Demo Metabox Post Type: post */  This comment block tells Piklist you want to name your metabox, “My Demo Metabox”, and have it display on the edit screen for a Post. To have this metabox work with a custom post type, you could also add a custom post type slug here as well. The Piklist comment block for metaboxes supports a lot more than just these two variables. You can view the full list in our docs.\nNow we start adding our fields. It’s best practice to make the “field” name all lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes or underscores, with no spaces or special characters if possible (i.e. facebook-page-url). The field label can be anything you want.\nLet’s create our first field, a text box:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  This simple array will create a text box that automatically saves as Post Meta.\nNow, let’s create our select field:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the drop-down.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) ));  Notice that this array is very similar to the one used to create the text box. Just two differences:\n type =\u0026gt; select: Tells Piklist that you want to render a select field. The choices array adds your choices.  That’s it! Everything else is the same.\nOne more field to go in this tutorial. Let’s create our ColorPicker field. Normally, you would need to add Javascript and CSS to create this field… but not with Piklist!\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Seriously, that’s all you need to create a ColorPicker field. You will notice this is pretty much the same code used to create the text box, except we set ‘type’ =\u0026gt; ‘colorpicker’.\nFull Code Snippet:  \u0026lt;?php /* Title: My Demo Metabox Post Type: post */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the drop-down.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Usage Where possible, Piklist uses the default WordPress functions to get things done, and using Post Meta is no different. You can use the get_post_meta() function to pull this data into your theme. Here’s how you would use these fields in your single.php file:\necho get_post_meta($post-\u0026gt;ID, 'demo_text', true); echo get_post_meta($post-\u0026gt;ID, 'demo_select', true); echo get_post_meta($post-\u0026gt;ID, 'demo_colorpicker', true);  get_post_meta() takes a second parameter, which can be set as true or false. Set to true if you want only a single row from the database, or false if you want every row it finds that matches the meta name.\n"

	"description": "Using Piklist with your plugin or theme.",
	"content": "While we understand why you may want to include Piklist in your plugin or theme, we believe it may negatively impact your users’ experience. Piklist is not a boilerplate framework and is always designed to be a standalone plugin. Piklist will not work properly if included in another plugin or theme.\nIf the user does install Piklist as a separate plugin, AND your plugin/theme, it invites multiple conflicts, including different versions of Piklist. This can cause your plugin, or other plugins/themes that rely on Piklist, not to work properly. In addition, you become solely responsible for keeping your code updated with the latest version of Piklist, instead of letting the user upgrade normally.\nAdditionally, if you plan on submitting your code to WordPress.org, they do not accept a plugin that includes an entire other plugin, inside it.\nTo make it easier for you to build your plugin on Piklist, we have created the Piklist Checker. By including the Checker in your plugin, your users will be notified if Piklist is not installed, and they will be walked through the installation.\nWe hope you agree that keeping Piklist as a separate plugin makes sense for both you and your users. If not, there are other frameworks you can choose from that are designed to be included in plugins and themes.\n"

It is absolutely free. Built-in demos are included, so you can see some of the features of Piklist in action.\nPiklist is a code-based framework, which means it has no user interface.

With Piklist you can usually use the same code you have written in one section and use it in another, allowing you to copy and paste, and save tons of time.\nWe’ve worked hard to make Piklist easy to use for beginners, and powerful enough for developers… and our users all agree!\nAbout this Tutorial Piklist is an incredibly powerful framework for WordPress. This tutorial only covers one feature of Piklist… adding custom fields. There is a lot more that Piklist can do, so check out the rest of the User Guide when you’ve finished this tutorial.\nLet’s get started!\nYou can easily create your project in a new or existing plugin, or your theme. In this tutorial we’ll create the project in your theme.\nPiklist Folder Structure To help keep your code organized, Piklist uses a pre-defined folder/file structure that makes it easy for you to add functionality to your site.\nPiklist utilizes a folder for each major section of WordPress. You create these folders in your theme or plugin and place the appropriate files in them. Piklist will automatically load these files correctly.\nFolder Structure for your theme If you want to use your theme for your Piklist files, open your theme’s main folder and add a folder called “piklist”. Inside that folder add another called “parts” and then add any Piklist folders you will need. Your folder structure should look like this:\n/theme-folder /piklist /parts /admin-pages (Do not use for settings pages) /dashboard /help /media /meta-boxes /notices /pointers /settings /terms /updates /users /widgets /workflows  Folder Structure for your plugin You can also create a Piklist plugin if you want. The folder structure is slightly different than the one for a theme. Open your plugin’s main folder and add a “parts” folder. In that folder add any folders you will need. Your folder structure should look like this:\n/plugin-folder /parts /admin-pages (Do not use for settings pages) /dashboard /help /media /meta-boxes /notices /pointers /settings /terms /updates /users /widgets /workflows  When creating a plugin you need let Piklist know this plugin depends on it. In the comment block of your main plugin file, you need to add: Plugin Type: Piklist. So your comment block should look something like this:\n/** * Plugin Name: Name Of The Plugin * Plugin URI: http://URI_Of_Page_Describing_Plugin_and_Updates * Description: A brief description of the Plugin. * Version: The Plugin's Version Number, e.g.: 1.0 * Author: Name Of The Plugin Author * Author URI: http://URI_Of_The_Plugin_Author * Plugin Type: Piklist */  A more detailed doc on writing Piklist plugins can be found here: Writing a Plugin for Piklist\nGrouping fields Overview Now that we have our folder structure set up, it’s time to add some files. Each file you add to a parts folder will contain your fields. These files allow you to group fields together and you can also have multiple files in each parts folder. For example, each file in the “meta-boxes” folder will create a metabox for a Post Type. Each file in the “users” folder will create a user field section. Each file in the “widgets” folder will create a Widget (yes, you can easily create widgets with Piklist). [TODO: ADD LINK]\nComment blocks Configuration options for each field group are defined in the comment block at the top of each file. These comment blocks are similar to what WordPress uses for plugin headers. They allow you to easily configure a group of fields with no hooks or filters.\nA full list of Comment Block parameters can be found here.\nCreate a new file in your “meta-boxes” folder called my-fields.php. At the top of the file, add this comment block:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Title: My custom fields * Post Type: post */  In this comment block you just defined two configuration parameters: Title: The title of your metabox. Post Type: Which post type(s) should display this metabox.\nSave the file. Now open WordPress and go to “Add new Post”. You should see an empty metabox with the title “My custom fields”. You just created your first metabox with Piklist!\nConfiguration Options The comment block at the top of each parts file defines configuration options for a field group. Each field type (i.e. metaboxes, settings, widgets, etc) have different configuration options. Some configuration parameters can take multiple values. For example, the “Post Type” parameter can accept multiple Post Types separated by commas.\nChange the “Post Type” parameter to this: Post Type: post, page so your code will look like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Title: My custom fields * Post Type: post, page */  Save the file. Open WordPress and add a new Page. You will see the same empty metabox that you added to Posts. Using this method you can easily use the same field code to multiple Post Types.\nAdding Fields Overview Piklist fields can be added almost anywhere in WordPress by using a very simple function. In most cases, the code you use to create a field in one area of WordPress can be used in all other areas as well. So, for example, if you already created a field for a Post Type and you also wanted to use it for a User Profile page, you can just copy and paste it.\nFields Now that we created our metabox, it’s time to add some fields. Under the comment block add the following field code so your file looks like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Title: My custom fields * Post Type: post, page */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'field_one' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'First Field' ));  The piklist(\u0026lsquo;field\u0026rsquo;) function accepts tons of parameters. This example used just three:\ntype: The type of field. In this case “text”.\nfield: The name of the field. This is where the field data will be saved in the database.\nlabel: A label that displays next to the field.\nSave the file. Go back to WordPress and add a new Post or a new Page. You will see a text field with the label “First Field” in your metabox.\nAdd more fields Now go back to your file, copy the field code (not the comment block), and paste it under the first field. Change the type to colorpicker, the field parameter to ‘field_two’, and the label to ‘Second field’. Your file should now look like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Title: My custom fields * Post Type: post, page */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'field_one' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'First Field' )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'field_two' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Second Field' ));  Save the file. Go back to WordPress and add a new Post or Page. You now have two fields: a text box and a colorpicker.\nClick inside the field and a color palette will pop up. You just created a colorpicker field by copying your existing text field code and making a few small changes.\nUtilizing the same code everywhere. As mentioned in the Tutorial introduction, one of the biggest benefits of Piklist is that it’s a code-based framework. You can easily copy and paste your code from one object type to another.\nCopy and Paste programming In the “users” folder you created in step 3, create a new file. Now open the file in your “meta-boxes” folder, select everything and copy. Open the file in your users folder and paste. The file in your “users” folder should be an exact duplicate of the one that’s in your “meta-boxes” folder.\nSince Users aren’t a Post Type, delete the line in your comment block that says: Post Type: post, page. Your file should look like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Title: My custom fields */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'field_one' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'First Field' )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'field_two' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Second Field' ));  Press save. Open WordPress and edit any users profile. You will see this field under the section “My custom fields”.\nYou just utilized the same code for a User Profile, that you wrote for a Post Type. This is a huge time saver and you will find this feature invaluable.\nBuilt-in Demos Now that you understand how easy it is to create fields with Piklist, we’re sure you’re excited to get started. To help you along, Piklist comes with built-in demos that contain tons of field configurations that you can easily copy and paste into your own project. You can learn more about Piklist Demos here.\nVideo Overview The initial public unveiling of Piklist at WordCampNYC 2012.   "

	"content": " Writing a plugin to take advantage of Piklist is very simple. The only additional step is registering your plugin with Piklist, otherwise, this is just like writing a regular WordPress plugin. Like all plugins, Piklist plugins also live in your wp-content/plugins/ folder.\nRegistering your plugin with Piklist When writing WordPress plugins that rely on other plugins, you usually have to use hooks and filters… but not with Piklist. We’ve simplified the process for you.\n First create a folder to hold your plugin. The folder name can be anything you want… this is the same as any other plugin you would write.\n Then create your main plugin file, and make sure it’s the same name as your folder. So if your plugin is in the folder /my-cool-plugin/, then the main file should be named my-cool-plugin.php, as suggested on WordPress.org.\n Now, add the standard WordPress file headers to the top… this is also the same as any other plugin you would write.\n Now, here’s how you tell Piklist your plugin exists. Add one more line to the file header you just created: Plugin Type: Piklist. That’s it! Your new plugin header would look something like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Plugin Name: Name Of The Plugin Plugin URI: http://URI_Of_Page_Describing_Plugin_and_Updates Description: A brief description of the Plugin. Version: The Plugin's Version Number, e.g.: 1.0 Author: Name Of The Plugin Author Author URI: http://URI_Of_The_Plugin_Author Plugin Type: Piklist License: A \u0026quot;Slug\u0026quot; license name e.g. GPL2 */ ?\u0026gt;  As long as you have Piklist activated on your site, this plugin will now run properly.\n  Now you just need to create the proper folder structure so you can start creating fields and more.\nCreating plugins has never been easier!\nAdding your plugin to WordPress.org Let your users know Piklist is powering your plugin:\n Add a “Powered by Piklist” logo to your plugin banner. You can download it here \u0026gt;\n Add “Piklist” as a tag in your readme.txt file.\n Add the following information to your readme.txt file. This code is formatted for markup, which WordPress.org uses to parse your readme.txt file. The spaces after the second line are intentional and create a line break.\n  \u0026gt; #### Powered by Piklist \u0026gt; WordPress Helpers requires the Piklist framework. \u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/piklist/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;You can download and install Piklist for free.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;  "

The difference is, the plugin lives in the /add-ons folder in your theme or plugin.\n Review the Piklist folder structure and create an /add-ons folder in the appropriate location.\n Add another folder to hold your plugin. It should look like: /add-ons/my-plugin.\n Now write your plugin as you normally would.\n  When your theme or plugin is activated, you will find your add-on, in the \u0026ldquo;Piklist \u0026gt; Add-ons\u0026rdquo; menu.\n"

You create these folders in your theme or plugin and place the appropriate files in them.

Your folder structure should look like this:\n/theme-folder /piklist /add-ons /parts /admin-pages (Do not use for settings pages) /dashboard /help /media /meta-boxes /notices /pointers /settings /terms /updates /users /widgets /workflows  Folder Structure for your plugin You can also create a Piklist plugin if you want. The folder structure is slightly different than the one for a theme. Open your plugin’s main folder and add a “parts” folder. In that folder add any folders you will need.

	"description": "Insert a subtitle filed to the Post screen",
	"content": "  New to Piklist?    Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     The Piklist folder structure makes it very easy to create Meta-Boxes, Settings Sections, etc, with limited code. Sometimes, however, you may need to insert a field in a specific place. Usually this is tied to a WordPress hook.\nThe Piklist field function, can be used outside the Piklist folder structure, and placed inside a standard function.\nFor this tutorial, we will insert a “Subtitle” field, under the Post Title field. A few things:\n The following code will go into your Theme’s functions.php file, or your plugin file. It does NOT go into the Piklist parts/ directory. To place a field after the Post Title, we are going to use to the standard WordPress hook, edit_form_after_title. This hook allows you to insert information after the Post Title field. The same Piklist field function that we would use in a parts/ folder, we will use in a function instead.  Here’s the code:\nfunction my_add_sub_title() { piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'template' =\u0026gt; 'field' // format the field without a label ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'large-text' ,'placeholder' =\u0026gt; 'Enter subtitle here' ) )); } add_action('edit_form_after_title', 'my_add_sub_title');  "

This will tell WordPress not to render the excerpt box.\nBuilt in post type Use the standard WordPress function remove_post_type_support, to remove the editor. For example, to remove the editor from Posts, place this in your theme’s functions.php file, or your main plugin file:\nfunction my_remove_post_type_support() { remove_post_type_support('post', 'excerpt'); } add_action('init', 'my_remove_post_type_support', 10);  Now, add your own editor with Piklist  Create your metabox. Add the excerpt field, and make sure you set the following:  'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post' since WordPress saves this data in the post table.

	"content": " Description Piklist makes it radically easy to add meta-boxes and fields to your media items. In this tutorial, we will create a meta-box that includes three fields, select, text and ColorPicker, for standard posts.\n  New to Piklist?    Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     Each file we add to the the media/ folder will create a metabox on the media edit screen. Each field we include in this file will be part of this metabox. Fairly straightforward. Ok, let’s create our Media metabox file!\nCreate a new file in your /parts/media/ folder: let’s call it media-metabox.php. At the top of the file, we will add a comment block that will control the configuration of the metabox. This comment block is very similar to what you would see in a standard WordPress plugin or theme. Here is the minimum variable required:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Title: My Media Metabox */  This comment block tells Piklist you want to name your Media metabox, “My Media Metabox\u0026rdquo;. The Piklist comment block for Media metaboxes supports a lot more than just these two variables. You can view the full list in our docs.\nNow we start adding our fields. It’s best practice to make the “field” name all lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes or underscores, with no spaces or special characters if possible (i.e. facebook-page-url). The field label can be anything you want.\nLet’s create our first field, a text box:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Since Media items in WordPress are really a Post Type, this data will be saved as post meta.\nNow, let’s create our select field:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the drop-down.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) ));  Notice that this array is very similar to the one used to create the text box. Just two differences:\n type =\u0026gt; select: Tells Piklist that you want to render a select field. The choices array adds your choices.  That’s it! Everything else is the same.\nOne more field to go in this tutorial. Let’s create our ColorPicker field. Normally, you would need to add Javascript and CSS to create this field… but not with Piklist!\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Seriously, that’s all you need to create a ColorPicker field. You will notice this is pretty much the same code used to create the text box, except we set ‘type’ =\u0026gt; ‘colorpicker’.\nFull Code Snippet: \u0026lt;?php /* Title: My Media Metabox */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the drop-down.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Usage Where possible, Piklist uses the default WordPress functions to get things done, and using Post Meta is no different. You can use the get_post_meta() function to pull this data into your theme. Here’s how you would use these fields in your single.php file:\necho get_post_meta($attachment-\u0026gt;ID, 'demo_text', true); echo get_post_meta($attachment-\u0026gt;ID, 'demo_select', true); echo get_post_meta($attachment-\u0026gt;ID, 'demo_colorpicker', true);  get_post_meta() takes a second parameter, which can be set as true or false. Set to true if you want only a single row from the database, or false if you want every row it finds that matches the meta name.\n"

	"description": "Creating WordPress Settings pages with Piklist is as easy as creating any other field type.",
	"content": " Creating WordPress Settings pages with Piklist is as easy as creating any other field type. First we register the Settings page, and then we start adding Settings sections. Piklist uses the standard WordPress settings API, plus it adds extra power and ease of use. You can use any Piklist field type on a Settings page, and easily add Tabs as well.\nIn this tutorial, we will create a Settings Page that includes three fields: select, text and colorPicker, with tooltip help.\nRegister your Settings Page Like everything in Piklist, we start with a simple but powerful array. Then we hook it to the proper Piklist function. If you’re creating this settings page in your theme then this code belongs in functions.php. If this is a Settings page for a plugin, then add it to the main file in your plugin, after you register your plugin with Piklist.\nadd_filter('piklist_admin_pages', 'piklist_theme_setting_pages'); function piklist_theme_setting_pages($pages) { $pages[] = array( 'page_title' =\u0026gt; __('Custom Settings') ,'menu_title' =\u0026gt; __('Settings', 'piklist') ,'sub_menu' =\u0026gt; 'themes.php' //Under Appearance menu ,'capability' =\u0026gt; 'manage_options' ,'menu_slug' =\u0026gt; 'custom_settings' ,'setting' =\u0026gt; 'my_theme_settings' ,'menu_icon' =\u0026gt; plugins_url('piklist/parts/img/piklist-icon.png') ,'page_icon' =\u0026gt; plugins_url('piklist/parts/img/piklist-page-icon-32.png') ,'single_line' =\u0026gt; true ,'default_tab' =\u0026gt; 'Basic' ,'save_text' =\u0026gt; 'Save Demo Settings' ); return $pages; }  Create a Settings Section Now we need to create the proper folder structure in your theme. Piklist uses this folder structure to automatically help you when building fields. Create a piklist folder, and then a parts subfolder, and then add a settings subfolder. You can see the supported Piklist folder structure here. Each file we add to the the settings folder will create a Settings section on the Settings page. You can have multiple Sections on each Settings page as well. Each field we include in this file will be part of this Section. Fairly straightforward. OK, let’s create our Settings section file!\n Create a new file: let’s call it demo-settings.php. At the top of the file, we will add a comment block that will control the configuration of the Settings section. This comment block is very similar to what you would see in a standard WordPress plugin or theme. Here are the minimum variables required:  \u0026lt;?php /* Title: Theme Settings Section Setting: my_theme_settings */  This comment block tells Piklist you want to name your Settings section, “My Demo Settings Section”, and you want to associate this Section with the Settings page that uses the setting “demo-setting”. When you registered your Settings page, earlier in this tutorial, this is the setting you defined. The Piklist comment block for settings supports a lot more than just these two variables. You can view the full list in our docs.\n Now, let’s create our first field, a TEXT BOX:  piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  This simple array will create a TEXT BOX that automatically uses the WordPress settings API to display and save. The 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' variable tells Piklist what sort of field to render. Also, notice that this is very similar to the way you create fields for metaboxes.\n Now, let’s create our next field, a SELECT FIELD:  piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the drop-down.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) ));  Notice that this array is very similar to the one used to create the text box. Just two differences:\n 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select': Tells Piklist that you want to render a select field. The choices array adds your choices.  That’s it! Everything else is the same.\n One more field to go in this tutorial. Let’s create our ColorPicker field. Normally, you would need to add Javascript and CSS to create this field… but not with Piklist!   piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Seriously, that’s all you need to create a ColorPicker field. You will notice this is pretty much the same code used to create the text box, except we set 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker'.\nFull code snippet  /* Title: Theme Settings Section Setting: my_theme_settings */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Select Box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Choose from the drop-down.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'option1' =\u0026gt; 'Option 1' ,'option2' =\u0026gt; 'Option 2' ,'option3' =\u0026gt; 'Option 3' ) )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'colorpicker' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose a color' ,'value' =\u0026gt; '#aee029' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Click in the box to select a color.' ,'help' =\u0026gt; 'This is help text.' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  Using these fields in a theme: Where possible, Piklist uses the default WordPress functions to get things done, and using Settings is no different. You can use the standard WordPress function get_option to pull this data into your theme. Here’s how you would use these fields in your theme file:\n$theme_options = get_option('my_theme_settings'); $text_field = $theme_options['text']; $select_field = $theme_options['select']; $colorpicker_field = $theme_options['colorpicker']; echo 'This is a text field' . $text_field;  "

	"content": " Description Piklist makes it easy to show one or more fields, based on the value of another field, and so much more. The Piklist conditions parameter is very powerful, and you can see all the options in the documentation.\nIn this tutorial, if the user clicks on the “Yes” radio button to subscribe to our newsletter, we will show an “Email” text field.\n Conditional fields work on almost every page in WordPress. In this tutorial we are going to build these fields for a Post.\n First let’s build a metabox using our base tutorial. You can stop at \u0026ldquo;Adding Fields\u0026rdquo;, since we will be creating our own fields.\n Now, let’s add two fields:\n The Control field will be a radio button The Conditional field will only display if “Yes” is selected in the radio button.   Build the Control Field Building the Control field in Piklist is exactly the same as building any other field. There is absolutely nothing different about it. In this case, we are going to build the standard radio field that will ask the user if they want to subscribe to the newsletter:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'radio' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'subscribe_to_newsletter' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Would you like to subscribe to our newsletter?' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'yes' =\u0026gt; 'Yes' ,'no' =\u0026gt; 'No' ) ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'no' ));  Note, that we set value =\u0026gt; 'no'. This sets the default value of the field to “No”, which hides the email box.\nBuild the Conditional Field Let’s start with a standard Piklist text box.\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'email_address' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Email Address' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Please enter your email address' ) ));  Now we are going to add the \u0026ldquo;conditions\u0026rdquo; array:\n,'conditions' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'field' =\u0026gt; 'subscribe_to_newsletter' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'yes' ) )  This array can actually hold a variety of conditions. In this case, we are saying: If the field “subscribe_to_newsletter” (our Control field name) equals yes, then show this field.\nAll together the conditional field looks like this:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'email_address' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Email Address' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Please enter your email address' ,'conditions' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'field' =\u0026gt; 'subscribe_to_newsletter' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'yes' ) ) ));  Full Code Snippet: piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'radio' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'subscribe_to_newsletter' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Would you like to subscribe to our newsletter?' ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( 'yes' =\u0026gt; 'Yes' ,'no' =\u0026gt; 'No' ) ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'no' )); piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'email_address' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Email Address' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Please enter your email address' ,'conditions' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'field' =\u0026gt; 'subscribe_to_newsletter' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'yes' ) ) ));  "

	"content": "Custom Post Statuses are at the heart of any web application built with WordPress, and Piklist makes it easy for you to implement them. No longer are you stuck with draft, pending review and published. You can add whatever post statuses you choose.\nA few important caveats:\n Due to the nature of WordPress, your first post status has to remain “draft”. You can change the label so it displays “New”, or “Howdy”, but the key in the post status array will have to remain draft (we’ll explain more later in the tutorial). Some themes may not display your post if the status is not published, so you may have to modify your theme’s loop to show it. This parameter does not ADD statuses to the Post Type, it removes the default WordPress statuses and REPLACES them.  Like most items in Piklist, we will use an array of values to add our Custom Post Statuses. Piklist has a bunch of parameters to use with Custom Post Types, the one we will use is status. Add this to your Custom Post Type you registered with the Piklist filter piklist_post_types:\n'status' =\u0026gt; array( 'draft' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'New' ) )  This code tells Piklist to rename the draft status to New. Due to the nature of WordPress, your first status must always be draft. We just renamed it to New.\nThe second post status just gets added to this array. The “Request for Estimate” status looks like this:\n'status' =\u0026gt; array( 'draft' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'New' ) ,'estimate' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Request for Estimate' )  You’ve just created post status named “estimate”, with the label “Request for Estimate”.\nJust continue adding your statuses to the array until you’re done. Here’s the full code snippet for creating the Custom Post Type from step 1, and adding in all the post statuses from the image above:\nadd_filter('piklist_post_types', 'demo_post_type'); function demo_post_type($post_types) { $post_types['demo'] = array( 'labels' =\u0026gt; piklist('post_type_labels', 'Demo') ,'title' =\u0026gt; __('Enter a new Demo Title') ,'public' =\u0026gt; true ,'rewrite' =\u0026gt; array( 'slug' =\u0026gt; 'demo' ) ,'supports' =\u0026gt; array( 'author' ,'revisions' ) ,'hide_meta_box' =\u0026gt; array( 'slug' ,'author' ,'revisions' ,'comments' ,'commentstatus' ) ,'status' =\u0026gt; array( 'draft' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'New' ) ,'shipping-received' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Shipping Received' ) ,'inspection-wfa' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Inspection: Waiting for Approval' ) ,'inspection' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Inspection Approved' ) ,'work-order-pca' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Work Order, PCA' ) ,'repair-queue' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Repair Queue' ) ,'paint-queue' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Paint Queue' ) ,'jbp-paint-queue' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'JBP Paint Queue' ) ,'shipped' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Pending Shipment' ) ,'closed' =\u0026gt; array( 'label' =\u0026gt; 'Closed' ) ) ); return $post_types; }  "

Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     First, you will need to create your taxonomy using the piklist_taxonomies filter.\nWe’ll assume you will be using a non-hierarchical( like \u0026ldquo;Tags\u0026rdquo; ) taxonomy, and we will name them \u0026lsquo;personal_tags\u0026rsquo;. However, we will do something special with the name. To allow separate taxonomies for each logged in user, we will append their user ID to the end of the taxonomy name. So the user with the ID of 1, will be using \u0026lsquo;personal_tags_1\u0026rsquo;, and the user with the ID of 2, will be using \u0026lsquo;personal_tags_1\u0026rsquo;.\nFull snippet add_filter('piklist_taxonomies', 'my_custom_taxonomies'); function my_custom_taxonomies($taxonomies) { global $current_user; get_currentuserinfo(); // Get logged in user info $taxonomies[] = array( 'post_type' =\u0026gt; array('post') ,'name' =\u0026gt; 'personal_tags_' . $current_user-\u0026gt;ID // Append User ID to taxonomy name ,'configuration' =\u0026gt; array( 'hierarchical' =\u0026gt; false ,'labels' =\u0026gt; piklist('taxonomy_labels', $current_user-\u0026gt;display_name . \u0026quot;'s Tag\u0026quot;) // Append user name to Taxonomy labels ,'show_ui' =\u0026gt; true ,'query_var' =\u0026gt; true ,'rewrite' =\u0026gt; array( 'slug' =\u0026gt; 'personal_tags_' . $current_user-\u0026gt;ID // Append user ID to taxonomy slug ) ,'show_admin_column' =\u0026gt; true ,'comments' =\u0026gt; true ) ); return $taxonomies; }  "

If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     We’re are going to use the WordPress function wp_get_nav_menus(), to get our menus. This function stores data in an array, and with Piklist, parsing an array and displaying it as a list is really easy. This array stores all menus in an Object, and then breaks them out. You have access to fields like term_id, name, slug, etc. We are going to assign each item in the dropdown to the slug, but show the name:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'sidebar_left' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Choose Sidebar Menu' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'none' ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( '' =\u0026gt; 'Choose Menu' ) + piklist(wp_get_nav_menus() ,array( 'slug' ,'name' ) ) ));  Let’s take a look at this code:\n First we created a standard Piklist Select list. The only major change is the choices array. We told Piklist to use the wp_get_nav_menus() function. The next array tells Piklist what should be the KEY for the field, and what should be the VALUE. In this case we selected slug as the KEY, and name as the VALUE to show in the list.  Checkbox:\nTo make this a Checkbox, just change 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select', to 'type' =\u0026gt; 'checkbox'.\nRadio Buttons:\nTo make this Radio Buttons, just change 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select', to 'type' =\u0026gt; 'radio'.\nYes, it’s that easy!\n"

This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     In this example, we are going to pull the standard WordPress categories, this works for custom taxonomies as well.\nWe’re are going to use the WordPress function get_terms(), to get our taxonomy values. This function stores data in an array, and with Piklist, parsing an array and displaying it as a Select List is really easy. As you can see from the WordPress Codex page, this array stores all data in an Object, and then breaks them out. You have access to fields like term_id, name, parent etc. We are going to assign each item in the select list to the term_id, but show the name. This is added to the Piklist parameter choices:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'taxonomy' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'category' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Categories' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Terms will appear when they are added to this taxonomy.' ,'choices' =\u0026gt; array( '' =\u0026gt; 'Choose Term' ) + piklist(get_terms(array( 'taxonomy' =\u0026gt; 'piklist_demo_type' ,'hide_empty' =\u0026gt; false )) ,array( 'term_id' ,'name' ) ) ));  Let’s take a look at this code:\n First we created a standard Piklist Select list. Notice we set the scope here. In most cases Piklist will automatically determine the scope. But when SAVING to a taxonomy you will need to set 'scope' =\u0026gt; 'taxonomy'. Here we are saving to the taxonomy \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo;. If this code was on a Settings page, and you wanted to save this data as a Setting, you would not set Scope. The choices array gets pulled in dynamically. We told Piklist to use the get_terms() function, and told it to get the piklist_demo_type taxonomy values. We also passed the hide_empty parameter to Piklist. This parameter is standard to the get_terms() function and can be found at the Codex. The next array tells Pikist what should be the KEY for the field, and what should be the VALUE. In this case we selected term_id as the KEY, and name as the VALUE to show in the list.  Radio Buttons: To make these Radio Buttons, just change 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select', to 'type' =\u0026gt; 'radio'.\nCheckboxes: To make these Checkboxes, just change 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select', to 'type' =\u0026gt; 'checkbox'.\nYes, it’s that easy!\n"

See example below.\n Input: boolean Default: false  // required with Piklist piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'text_required' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Enter some required text' ,'required' =\u0026gt; true ));  // required with Piklist and HTML 5 piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'text_required_2' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Enter some required text' ,'required' =\u0026gt; true ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'required' =\u0026gt; 'required' // HTML 5 validation ) ));  role Set the user role that will see this field.\n Input: comma-delimited Default: none  Examples: 'role' =\u0026gt; 'editor' 'role' =\u0026gt; 'super-editor, editor, author'\nsanitize Untrusted data entered into your form should be sanitized and validated before saving. By default Piklist uses the WordPress $wpdb-\u0026gt;prepare method to handle your data, insuring it is SQL-escaped before saving to prevent against SQL injection attacks.\nPiklist also adds another level of sanitization you can use at the field level, and makes it easy to use. A library of sanitization functions are included with Piklist, or you can create your own.\nSince data sanitization depends on the type of data and the context in which it is used, the sanitize parameter allows you to choose how to clean your data, and accepts the following parameters:\n Input: parameters  Sub Parameters: type The type of sanitization function to run. 'type' =\u0026gt; 'html_class'\noptions An array of arguments to pass to the function. 'options' =\u0026gt; array( 'fallback' =\u0026gt; 'my-default-fallback' )\ncallback Override the default Piklist callback function with your own. 'callback' =\u0026gt; 'my-custom-callback\nExamples:\n// sanitize parameter example. Must be in field function ,'sanitize' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'html_class' ,'options' =\u0026gt; array( 'fallback' =\u0026gt; 'my-default-class' ) ,'callback' =\u0026gt; 'my-custom-callback' ) )  // Use the built-in sanitize function: file_name piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'File Name' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'sanitize_file_name' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Converts multiple words to a valid file name' ,'sanitize' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'file_name' ) ) ));  save_as  Input: string  save_id  Input: string Default: null  scope The scope parameter tells Piklist where to save field data. In many cases this is the WordPress database table (i.e. post, post_meta, term, term_meta)\nWhen creating fields for the WordPress admin, in most cases, you do not have to define scope. Piklist will automatically set it for you.\nYou MUST define scope when creating front-end forms.\nPiklist allows you to mix-and-match field types within a form. So, one form can have fields that save information as post_meta, while other fields save to a taxonomy. Scope is what determines where the field data is saved. If you don’t set the scope parameter then it will default to where the field is used. For example, if you are creating a meta-box, then scope will automatically be set to post_meta. When working with front-end forms, you must set the scope for each field, so Piklist knows where to save your data.\nIf you want create a field that saves the post_title, then you would set scope to post, since the post_title field is in the wp_posts database table.\n Input: string Default: piklist_form::get_field_scope()  Example: 'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post'\nsortable If set to false, will stop an add_more field from being sortable.\n Input: boolean Default: true  tax_query  Input: parameters  template Define a Piklist field template.\n Input: string  type The type of field.\n Input: string Default: text  Examples: 'type' =\u0026gt;'text' 'type' =\u0026gt;'radio' 'type' =\u0026gt;'editor' 'type' =\u0026gt;'group'\nvalidate Validate this field with a set of validation rules.\n Input: parameters  value The default value for this field.\n Input: string Default: null  wrapper The default value for this field.\n Input: string Default: null  "

The grid system is really helpful when laying out group fields.\n Input: numeric values: Any number 1-12  Examples: 'columns' =\u0026gt; 1 'columns' =\u0026gt; 12\nConditions Set conditions for your fields.\n Input: parameters values: An array of conditions  Sub Parameters: relation When using multiple conditions, the default logic is AND. Use this parameter to change the logic to OR. Examples: 'relation' =\u0026gt; 'or' 'relation' =\u0026gt; 'and'\nfield The name of the field you will be watching for Hide/Show, or the field you will be Updating. Example: 'field' =\u0026gt; 'my_field'\nvalue The value(s) of the field that will trigger the condition. This parameter also accepts an array of values. Examples: 'value' =\u0026gt; 'yes' 'value' =\u0026gt; array('yes', 'maybe')\nreset By default, any field that is hidden/shown will have their values reset. To prevent this set reset to false.

	"description": "Creating Shortcodes with Piklist is super easy.",
	"content": " Description Creating Shortcodes with Piklist is super easy. In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a shortcode to display post meta in your post content.\n  New to Piklist?    Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.      If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have a shortcodes folder, create one: /parts/shortcodes/ Next we need to create the shortcode files. Piklist shortcodes are made up of two:  shortcode-name.php: This file holds the shortcode output, and is the only required file for a shortcode. (i.e. example.php) shortcode-name-form.php: Settings fields for your shortcode are placed in this file. (i.e. example-form.php)   Shortcode Form File Let’s start with example-form.php, which will hold the fields the user will fill in to control the Shortcode. This file is only required if you want to add settings to your Shortcode.\nAt the top of the file add this code:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Name: Post Meta Description: Embed the value of post meta Shortcode: postmeta Inline: true */  This code is a PHP comment block that tells Piklist a few things: * Name: Name of your shortcode. * Description: A description of your shortcode. * Shortcode: The actual shortcode that will appear in your code. * Inline: Tells Piklist you want to display the shortcode output inline, instead of in a block.\nNow, let’s create our field, a text box for the Post Meta key:\npiklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'meta_key' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Meta Key' ));  At this point, you should see an \u0026ldquo;Add Shortcode\u0026rdquo; button on your edit post screen. If you press it, a form will pop up, and one of the shortcode options will be Meta Key. Enter a meta key and save.\nFull Snippet: Shortcode Form File \u0026lt;?php /* Name: Post Meta Description: Embed the value of post meta Shortcode: postmeta Inline: true */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'meta_key' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Meta Key' ));  Shortcode Output File The output file is the only required file, since settings may not be necessary for some shortcodes. Open example.php. At the top of the file, we will add a comment block that will control the configuration of the shortcode. This comment block is very similar to what you would see in a standard WordPress plugin or theme.

	"content": " WordPress hierarchical taxonomies allow you to assign terms to a parent term. In this tutorial we’ll show you how to group the child terms under each parent, and make the parent unselectable, forcing the user to only select the children.\nThe basis of this tutorial is the flexibility of the Piklist field function, which we will place in a foreach loop.\nThis tutorial assumes you have already created a hierarchical taxonomy or you’re using the default WordPress Categories. In our example we will be using a custom taxonomy called company_type.\n  New to Piklist?    Before you start this tutorial:  Install Piklist like you would any other WordPress plugin. Decide if you are going to add the code in this tutorial to your custom plugin or your theme. This will define how to setup your Piklist folder structure. If you're new to Piklist, you may want to review the \"Getting Started\" tutorial first. It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     First get the Parents Using the standard WordPress function get_terms(), we will first get all the Parents for this taxonomy. Setting 'parent' =\u0026gt; 0 returns all top-level terms.\n$parents = get_terms('company_type', array( 'hide_empty' =\u0026gt; false ,'parent' =\u0026gt; 0 ));  Next, assign the Children Now that we have the parents, we need to loop through each one, then show their child fields using the Piklist Field function. Then we pass some parameters to the Piklist Field function for each Parent ID.\nOnce again we will use the WordPress function get_terms(), to get our child taxonomy values. This function stores data in an array, and with Piklist, parsing an array and displaying it as Checkboxes (or Radio buttons… or a Select box) is really easy. As you can see from the WordPress Codex page, this array stores all data in an Object, and then breaks them out. You have access to fields like term_id, name, child_of etc.\nforeach ($parents as $parent =\u0026gt; $value) { piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'checkbox' ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'taxonomy' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'category' ,'label' =\u0026gt; $value-\u0026gt;name ,'choices' =\u0026gt; piklist( get_terms('category', array( 'hide_empty' =\u0026gt; false ,'child_of' =\u0026gt; $value-\u0026gt;term_id )) ,array( 'term_id' ,'name' ) ) )); }  Let’s take a look at this code:\n First we created a standard Piklist Checkbox list. Notice we set the scope here. In most cases Piklist will automatically determine the scope. But when using taxonomies you will need to set 'scope' =\u0026gt; 'taxonomy'. In this example we make the label parameter dynamic, passing it the Parent name $value-\u0026gt;name. The choices array gets pulled in dynamically. We told Piklist to use the get_terms() function, and told it to get the company_type taxonomy values. We also passed it two parameters: hide_empty and child_of. Both standard for get_terms(). We set child_of as the Parent term id: $value-\u0026gt;term_id. The next array in the choices array tells Pikist what should be the KEY for the field, and what should be the VALUE. In this case we selected term_id as the KEY, and name as the VALUE to show in the list.  Full snippet $parents = get_terms(array( 'taxonomy' =\u0026gt; 'company_type' ,'hide_empty' =\u0026gt; false ,'parent' =\u0026gt; 0 )); foreach ($parents as $parent =\u0026gt; $value) { piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'checkbox' ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'taxonomy' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'company_type' ,'label' =\u0026gt; $value-\u0026gt;name ,'choices' =\u0026gt; piklist( get_terms(array( 'taxonomy' =\u0026gt; 'company_type' ,'hide_empty' =\u0026gt; false ,'child_of' =\u0026gt; $value-\u0026gt;term_id )) ,array( 'term_id' ,'name' ) ) )); }  "

This tutorial will show you how using two Piklist filters: piklist_get_file_data and piklist_add_part.\nAll of the code in this tutorial will go in your theme’s functions.php file, or your main plugin file.\nAdd a custom parameter to the Piklist comment block. Pikist uses a number of parameters in the comment block to control access to a meta box. The first step is to tell Piklist you want to use a custom parameter using the piklist_part_data filter. We’ll name our parameter \u0026ldquo;Hide for Template\u0026rdquo;.\nadd_filter('piklist_part_data', 'my_custom_comment_block', 10, 2); function my_custom_comment_block($data, $folder) { // If not a Meta-box section than bail if($folder!= 'meta-boxes') { return $data; } // Allow Piklist to read our custom comment block attribute: \u0026quot;Hide for Template\u0026quot;, and set it to hide_for_template $data['hide_for_template'] = 'Hide for Template'; return $data; }  Assign meta-box access to user role, “no-role”, if the page template is selected One of the parameters you can use in the Piklist comment block is role. This allows you to set which user role has access to a meta-box. In this step, we are going to change which user role can view the meta-box ONLY if our page template is selected. We’ll change the meta-box access to a made up user role called “no-role”.\nadd_filter('piklist_part_process_callback', 'my_hide_for_template', 10, 2); function my_hide_for_template($part, $type) { global $post; // If not a meta box than bail if($type != 'meta-boxes') { return $part; } // Check if any page template is set in the comment block if (!empty($part['data']['hide_for_template'])) { // Get the active page template $active_template = pathinfo(get_page_template_slug($post-\u0026gt;ID), PATHINFO_FILENAME); $active_template = empty($active_template) ? 'default' : $active_template; // Does the active page template match what we want to hide? if (strpos($part['data']['hide_for_template'], $active_template) !== false) { // Change meta-box access to user role: no-role $part['data']['role'] = 'no-role'; } } return $part; }  Usage In the comment block of the meta-box where you want to restrict access, use your new parameter: Hide for Template\n/* Title: Custom Sections Post type: page Hide for Template: full-width, another-template */  IMPORTANT: You need to change your template and press SAVE to hide the metaboxes.\n"

	"content": "Piklist’s Workflow system is incredibly powerful. It allows you to divide a page into different tabs. In this tutorial, we’ll use the Workflows to divide the default WordPress add new Post page.\n Review the \u0026ldquo;Building Your First Workflow\u0026rdquo; tutorial to get an idea how they work. For this tutorial, we will need to create one Workflow HEADER, and two Workflow TAB files. Additionally, we will need to write a quick function as well.\n First create your Workflow HEADER file. A header file is determined by setting the header parameter to true. It can be named anything and should contain just a comment block that looks like this:\n  \u0026lt;?php /* Flow: Add Post Page: post.php, post-new.php, post-edit.php Post Type: post Header: true Position: title */  Let’s break down the comment block:\n Flow: we are naming this flow “Add Post”. This is just a name that ties all the workflow files together. Page: Which pages should this flow appear on. Post Type: What post type should this flow work with. Header: Since this is the header file, this parameter should be true. Position: Where the flow should start on the page. In this case we are using \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo;, which Piklist maps to the WordPress edit_form_after_title action.  Now we are going to create two TAB files, for the two steps in this Workflow. Again, the files can be named anything. As long as they have these comment blocks, and are located in your parts/workflows directory, Piklist will render them. Here are the comment blocks for the two files:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Title: Step 1 Order: 10 Flow: Add Post Default: true */  \u0026lt;?php /* Title: Step 2 Order: 20 Flow: Add Post */  Let’s break down these comment blocks:\n Title: Tab title Order: What order should this tab appear in the flow. Flow: This is the same as we defined in the header file. Default: Which is the default tab.  At this point, you should have the Workflow setup with two tabs, with the Editor appearing in both. The next step is to only have the Editor appear in Step 1… so we need to remove it from Step 2. We are going to use the WordPress function remove_post_type_support to remove the Editor from Step 2. In your plugin file, or themes functions.php file, place this code:\nfunction my_remove_from_flow() { if ( isset( $_REQUEST['flow'] ) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $_REQUEST['flow'] == 'add_post' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $_REQUEST['flow_page'] == 'step_2' ) { remove_post_type_support( 'post', 'editor' ); } } add_action( 'admin_init', 'my_remove_from_flow' );  This code is hooking to admin_init(), and looking at the HTTP Request variable. If $_REQUEST is set to flow, and the flow is add_post (set in the header file), and the flow_page is step_2, then remove post type support for the Editor with Posts.\nThat’s it! You now have the default Add New Post page placed in a Piklist Flow. Refer to the Building Your First Workflow Tutorial to find out how to add fields to Step 2 of your Workflow.\n"

For an Order Management system, you may want an order notes field hidden until the estimate becomes an order. Well, Piklist makes it easy to do just that.\n  New to Piklist?

It gives you a good overview of how Piklist works.     In this tutorial, you will learn how to show or hide a meta-box or meta-field based on the Post Status.\n First let’s build a meta-box using our \u0026ldquo;Getting Started\u0026rdquo; tutorial. Once completed you should have a working Meta Box with three fields. Piklist allows you to show/hide the entire Meta Box by using the status parameter, or by individual field by using the on_post_status parameter.  SHOW entire Meta Box by Post Status(es) In the comment block at the top of your meta box file (demo-metabox.php if you used the base tutorial), add the following line of code:\nStatus: draft\nNow, this meta box will only show when the post is in the draft status.\nYou can also use a list of Post Statuses. For example, let’s says you have an Order Management system and you created your own set of custom post statuses. You only want to show this meta box when the order (a custom post type) is in the estimate and estimate-approved statuses. You would list them separately by a comma, with NO SPACES. So your code would look like this:\nStatus: estimate,estimate-approved\nIf you started with our base tutorial, then your full header code snippet would look like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Title: My Demo Meta Box Post Type: post Status: estimate,estimate-approved */  HIDE a Meta Field by Post Status(es) You can also hide individual fields by post status. Again, we start with the base tutorial. In this example, let’s hide the text box only when the post is in the publish status. Here we use the on_post_status parameter, which takes takes an array of parameters. It’s a little bit more complicated, but you can just copy and paste the code.\n'on_post_status' =\u0026gt; array( 'hide' =\u0026gt; 'publish' )  If we go back to our Order Management system example, we may want to hide this field if the order is in any of the following post statuses: ready-to-ship, in-shipping, shipped and closed. You can list them like this:\n 'on_post_status' =\u0026gt; array( 'hide' =\u0026gt; array( 'ready-to-ship','in-shipping','shipped','closed' ) )  If the statuses are in order, you can also just use a range of post statuses, separated by a double-hyphen. This code does the same thing as the one above:\n'on_post_status' =\u0026gt; array( 'hide' =\u0026gt; 'ready-to-ship--closed' )  The entire snippet for this field would look like this:\n piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'text' ,'field' =\u0026gt; 'demo_text' ,'label' =\u0026gt; 'Text box' ,'description' =\u0026gt; 'Field Description' ,'value' =\u0026gt; 'Default text' ,'on_post_status' =\u0026gt; array( 'hide' =\u0026gt; 'publish' ) ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'class' =\u0026gt; 'text' ) ));  "

	"description": "Piklist allows you to relate any object to any object.",
	"content": " Piklist relationships allow you to relate any object to any object.\nIn this tutorial we\u0026rsquo;ll use the classic books example, assuming our post types are book and chapter, and a user can be an author. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover the post_has, post_belongs, and relate_query parameters.\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re using Post Types, all this code goes in your /parts/meta-boxes/ folder.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s add the chapter relate field to the book post type. Create a file and add this code:\n/** * Title: Chapters * Post Type: book * Context: normal * Priority: high */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'title' =\u0026gt; 'Chapters' ,'choices' =\u0026gt; piklist(get_posts(array( 'numberposts' =\u0026gt; -1 ,'post_type' =\u0026gt; 'chapters' )), array('ID', 'post_title')) ,'relate' =\u0026gt; array( 'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post' ) ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'multiple' =\u0026gt; 'multiple' ) ));  Create a second file in the same /parts/meta-boxes/ folder. Now let\u0026rsquo;s add the books relate field to the author:\n/** * Title: Books * Capability: edit_books */ piklist('field', array( 'type' =\u0026gt; 'select' ,'title' =\u0026gt; 'Books' ,'choices' =\u0026gt; piklist(get_posts(array( 'numberposts' =\u0026gt; -1 ,'post_type' =\u0026gt; 'books' )), array('ID', 'post_title')) ,'relate' =\u0026gt; array( 'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post' ) ,'attributes' =\u0026gt; array( 'multiple' =\u0026gt; 'multiple' ) ));  Usage Like most parts of Piklist, you can use standard WordPress functions to retrieve your data. Relationships are not different.\nGet a book\u0026rsquo;s chapters:\n$chapters = get_posts(array( 'post_type' =\u0026gt; 'chapter' ,'numberposts' =\u0026gt; -1 ,'suppress_filters' =\u0026gt; false ,'relate_query' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'id' =\u0026gt; $book_id ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'belongs' ) ) ));  Same as the old method, and still works\n$chapters = get_posts(array( 'post_type' =\u0026gt; 'chapter' ,'numberposts' =\u0026gt; -1 ,'suppress_filters' =\u0026gt; false ,'post_belongs' =\u0026gt; $book_id ));  Get an author\u0026rsquo;s books:\n$books = get_posts(array( 'post_type' =\u0026gt; 'book' ,'numberposts' =\u0026gt; -1 ,'suppress_filters' =\u0026gt; false ,'relate_query' =\u0026gt; array( array( 'id' =\u0026gt; $user_id ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'user' ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'has' ) ) ));  Please note that we\u0026rsquo;re including scope in the relate array but I didn\u0026rsquo;t in the first example. This is because in the first example the scope is the same for both objects. I could put 'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post', but it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary.\nGet either books\u0026rsquo; authors\n$authors = get_users(array( 'relate_query' =\u0026gt; array( 'compare' =\u0026gt; 'OR' ,array( 'id' =\u0026gt; $book_one_id ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post' ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'belongs' ) ,array( 'id' =\u0026gt; $book_two_id ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'post' ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'belongs' ) ) ));  To get an author that has both books, you would simply change 'compare' =\u0026gt; 'OR' to 'compare' =\u0026gt; 'AND' – and this is not case sensitive.\nAdvanced example of getting books that belong to ( Author 1 AND Author 2 ) OR Author 3:\n$books = get_posts(array( 'post_type' =\u0026gt; 'book' ,'numberposts' =\u0026gt; -1 ,'suppress_filters' =\u0026gt; false ,'relate_query' =\u0026gt; array( 'compare' =\u0026gt; 'OR' ,array( 'compare' =\u0026gt; 'AND' ,array( 'id' =\u0026gt; $user_one_id ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'user' ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'has' ) 'id' =\u0026gt; $user_two_id ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'user' ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'has' ) ) ,array( 'id' =\u0026gt; $user_three_id ,'scope' =\u0026gt; 'user' ,'relate' =\u0026gt; 'has' ) ) ));  "
