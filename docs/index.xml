      <description>Whether you register a taxonomy via the standard WordPress function register_taxonomy, or through Piklist, you can still take advantage of many Piklist features. However, you can add some extra power to your Taxonomies by registering them the Piklist way. Piklist extends the register_taxonomy function with extra parameters to enable extra features. You can use the standard register_taxonomy parameters, plus additional ones defined by Piklist.

      <description>If your plugin needs an update procedure, Piklist makes it quite easy. First create a php file, and drop it in the updates folder. The file name should be the current version of your plugin. So, if the update procedure is for version 2.0 of your plugin, then the file name should be 2.0.php.

      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/what-is-piklist/</guid>
      <description>What is Piklist? Piklist is an incredibly powerful framework for WordPress. When using Piklist to enhance your WordPress themes or plugins, you will be able to build more powerful, flexible websites with less code. Just install Piklist as you would a normal WordPress plugin, and then start writing code in your theme or plugin. This website should help you get started and provide a quick reference.
Most people use Piklist to add fields in the WordPress admin area, but you can do a lot more with Piklist.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/how-to-include-piklist-in-plugin-or-theme/</guid>
      <description>While we understand why you may want to include Piklist in your plugin or theme, we believe it may negatively impact your users’ experience. Piklist is not a boilerplate framework and is always designed to be a standalone plugin. Piklist will not work properly if included in another plugin or theme.
If the user does install Piklist as a separate plugin, AND your plugin/theme, it invites multiple conflicts, including different versions of Piklist.</description>

      <description>Piklist allows you to work with WordPress like never before. At its basic level, you can easily create metaboxes/metafields (also known as custom fields) for Posts, Pages, media and user profiles, as well as easy Settings pages, Widgets and Dashboard Widgets. You will need to write a little bit of code to use Piklist, but it’s minimal and we’ve included lots of examples. Let’s get started!
 Install Piklist like you would any other Plugin.</description>

      <title>Why aren’t my fields saving?</title>
      <link>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/fields-not-saving/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/fields-not-saving/</guid>
      <description>The most common reason for fields not saving is because a post type uses the default WordPress “custom fields” meta box. This meta box actually duplicates the inputs used by your fields.
If you are registering a post type, make sure custom-fields is not in the “supports” array.
To remove the custom-fields meta box from a WordPress default post type, or one that is registered by another plugin, use remove_post_type_support().</description>

      <title>Is there a limit on the number of Piklist fields?</title>
      <link>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/number-of-fields-limit/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/number-of-fields-limit/</guid>
      <description>There is no limit to how many fields you can create and display with Piklist. However, your server limits how many can be used on each page.
This is not a Piklist issue&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s part of your servers configuration.
The most common solution is adjusting your max_vars setting. This is a PHP setting which sets the maximum variables that can be used in one page load.
Once you increase this limit, Piklist can finish rendering all it&amp;rsquo;s fields.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/update-script-not-running/</guid>
      <description>Piklist allows you to easily create update scripts that run on certain versions of your plugin. If the script doesn&amp;rsquo;t run, you may have an issue with the piklist_active_plugin_versions setting:
 Deactivate and delete Piklist Open your database. In the wp_options table, look for this field: piklist_active_plugin_versions and delete it. Reinstall piklist The piklist_active_plugin_versions should come back to your db. Log back into WordPress. The update script should run.  </description>

      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/getting-started/piklist-enable-your-theme/</guid>
      <description>Adding Piklist meta-boxes, fields, settings pages, Widgets, etc. to your theme is very easy.
 First you need to add the proper folder structure to your theme. Piklist works by searching the active theme for the /piklist folder and then processing the sub-folders and files within it.
 Most Piklist code will go in the folder structure you set up. But other Piklist code, like registering Post Types, would go in your theme’s functions.</description>

      <description>When writing field code, whether with Piklist or not, you should be extra cautious of how you handle data coming into WordPress and how it’s presented to the end user. Piklist makes sanitizing your data easy with the sanitize parameter.
Choose the appropriate type of sanitization for each of your fields.

      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/getting-started/writing-a-plugin-for-piklist/</guid>
      <description>Writing a plugin to take advantage of Piklist is very simple. The only additional step is registering your plugin with Piklist, otherwise, this is just like writing a regular WordPress plugin. Like all plugins, Piklist plugins also live in your wp-content/plugins/ folder.
Registering your plugin with Piklist When writing WordPress plugins that rely on other plugins, you usually have to use hooks and filters… but not with Piklist. We’ve simplified the process for you.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.piklist.com/getting-started/piklist-add-ons/</guid>
      <description>Piklist Add-ons allow you to put a plugin in your theme or Piklist plugin. This allows you to package full featured plugins that are only available when your theme or plugin is active.
A good example of this is the Piklist Demos that come with Piklist itself.
Creating a Piklist add-on is not much different than creating a Piklist plugin. The difference is, the plugin lives in the /add-ons folder in your theme or plugin.</description>

 To start, you should have a /parts folder in your theme or plugin to put Piklist parts files. Add a subfolder called /fields/. The structure should look like /parts/fields/. Create a file in the /fields/ folder. Any files in this folder can become fields automatically registered with Piklist. The name of your file is important since it will become the name of your field.</description>

      <description>Use the Piklist checker when creating plugins that require Piklist. The Piklist Checker makes it easy for you to notify users from your plugin or theme when Piklist is not active. Since your plugin or theme requires Piklist, not having Piklist installed and activated would provide an unpleasant user experience. Piklist Checker is designed to alleviate that.
If the user attempts to activate a Piklist plugin or theme, without activating Piklist first, they will get a message notifying them the plugin was deactivated and instructions on how to get Piklist.</description>

      <description>Creating WordPress Settings pages with Piklist is as easy as creating any other field type. First we register the Settings page, and then we start adding Settings sections. Piklist uses the standard WordPress settings API, plus it adds extra power and ease of use. You can use any Piklist field type on a Settings page, and easily add Tabs as well.
In this tutorial, we will create a Settings Page that includes three fields: select, text and colorPicker, with tooltip help.</description>

      <description>Description Piklist makes it easy to show one or more fields, based on the value of another field, and so much more. The Piklist conditions parameter is very powerful, and you can see all the options in the documentation.
In this tutorial, if the user clicks on the “Yes” radio button to subscribe to our newsletter, we will show an “Email” text field.
 Conditional fields work on almost every page in WordPress.</description>

      <description>Custom Post Statuses are at the heart of any web application built with WordPress, and Piklist makes it easy for you to implement them. No longer are you stuck with draft, pending review and published. You can add whatever post statuses you choose.
A few important caveats:
 Due to the nature of WordPress, your first post status has to remain “draft”. You can change the label so it displays “New”, or “Howdy”, but the key in the post status array will have to remain draft (we’ll explain more later in the tutorial).</description>

      <description>WordPress hierarchical taxonomies allow you to assign terms to a parent term. In this tutorial we’ll show you how to group the child terms under each parent, and make the parent unselectable, forcing the user to only select the children.
The basis of this tutorial is the flexibility of the Piklist field function, which we will place in a foreach loop.
This tutorial assumes you have already created a hierarchical taxonomy or you’re using the default WordPress Categories.</description>

      <description>Piklist works well with existing Post Types… those created with the standard WordPress function register_post_type. However, you can add some extra power to your Post Types by registering them the Piklist way. Piklist extends the register_post_type function with extra parameters to enable extra features. You can use the standard register_post_type() parameters, plus the additional Piklist Custom Post Type parameters.

This becomes extra powerful when paired with the Piklist capability parameter, which allows you to show/hide a field based on a user role or capability. For an Order Management system, you may want an order notes field hidden until the estimate becomes an order.</description>

In most cases you can use the same field code you used in the admin, plus you need to define the scope parameter. scope tells Piklist where to save your data. In the admin, this can be auto-detected, but not with front-end forms.

To disable the title field, do not pass &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; to the supports parameter when registering a post type.</description>
