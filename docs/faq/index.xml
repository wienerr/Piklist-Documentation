      <description>What is Piklist? Piklist is an incredibly powerful framework for WordPress. When using Piklist to enhance your WordPress themes or plugins, you will be able to build more powerful, flexible websites with less code. Just install Piklist as you would a normal WordPress plugin, and then start writing code in your theme or plugin. This website should help you get started and provide a quick reference.
Most people use Piklist to add fields in the WordPress admin area, but you can do a lot more with Piklist.</description>

      <title>How do I include Piklist in my plugin or theme?</title>

      <description>While we understand why you may want to include Piklist in your plugin or theme, we believe it may negatively impact your users’ experience. Piklist is not a boilerplate framework and is always designed to be a standalone plugin. Piklist will not work properly if included in another plugin or theme.
If the user does install Piklist as a separate plugin, AND your plugin/theme, it invites multiple conflicts, including different versions of Piklist.</description>

      <title>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION</title>
      <link>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/parse-error-syntax-error-unexpected-t_function/</link>

      <description>If you’re getting this error, you are running an older version of PHP on your server.
Piklist, like WordPress, recommends PHP v5.6 or higher.
Please contact your host and ask them to upgrade you.</description>

      <title>Why aren’t my fields saving?</title>
      <link>https://docs.piklist.com/faq/fields-not-saving/</link>

      <description>The most common reason for fields not saving is because a post type uses the default WordPress “custom fields” meta box. This meta box actually duplicates the inputs used by your fields.
If you are registering a post type, make sure custom-fields is not in the “supports” array.
To remove the custom-fields meta box from a WordPress default post type, or one that is registered by another plugin, use remove_post_type_support().</description>
