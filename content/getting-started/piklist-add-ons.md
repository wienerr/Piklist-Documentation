Piklist Add-ons allow you to put a plugin in your theme or Piklist plugin. This allows you to package full featured plugins that are only available when your theme or plugin is active.

A good example of this is the [Piklist Demos](/getting-started/built-in-demos/) that come with Piklist itself.

Creating a Piklist add-on is not much different than creating a Piklist plugin. The difference is, the plugin lives in the `/add-ons` folder in your theme or plugin.

1. Review the [Piklist folder structure](/folder-structure/) and create an `/add-ons` folder in the appropriate location.

2. Add another folder to hold your plugin. It should look like: `/add-ons/my-plugin`.

3. Now [write your plugin](/getting-started/writing-a-plugin-for-piklist/) as you normally would.

When your theme or plugin is activated, you will find your add-on, in the "Piklist > Add-ons" menu.
